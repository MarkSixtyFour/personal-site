# student-site-project
A tweaked version of a full-stack web project I made for class as a portfolio piece. This contains both back-end and the front-end.

## About
The site is created using Bootstrap 4 and Express, using EJS as the templating engine and MongoDB for data storage. Anything too personal has been redacted. This is primarily to show I can do something full-stack. To set it up, you can just use `npm install` and run app.js. Make sure you have Mongo installed and running too.
